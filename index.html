		<h4>Qualitative Accomplishments</h4>
		<ol>
			<li><strong> Work Ethic-</strong> Will always work hard and give my best to any situation. <br>Must work on not over working to exhaustion.<br></li>

			<li><strong>Active Listener-</strong> Listens to others in detail, repeats back what people have said to make
				sure they are understood. <br> Can work on giving more feedback instead of just listening.<br> </li>

			<li><strong>Independent-</strong> Can accomplish tasks without needing to rely on others.
			<br>Can sometimes forget that you can learn a lot from team work environments.</li>
