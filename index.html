		<h4>My Learning Style</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Kinesthetic</li>
		</ul>
		<h4> Quantitative Accomplishments</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>In 2014, I received Manager of the Month from Norwegian Cruise</li>
			<li>In 2016 for a new cruise ship that was released, I created active programs for over 1,100 youth ages 3-17 </li>
			<li> On a weekly basis, I trained all new crew members and oriented them in policies and procedures for the youth programs</li>
		</ol>

		<h4>Qualitative Accomplishments</h4>
		<ol>
			<li><strong> Work Ethic-</strong> Will always work hard and give my best to any situation. <br>Must work on not over working to exhaustion.<br></li>

			<li><strong>Active Listener-</strong> Listens to others in detail, repeats back what people have said to make
				sure they are understood. <br> Can work on giving more feedback instead of just listening.<br> </li>

			<li><strong>Independent-</strong> Can accomplish tasks without needing to rely on others.
			<br>Can sometimes forget that you can learn a lot from team work environments.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>My Passion</h3>

		<p>I have been a teacher for the better part of my life. I have taught children ages 3-17 in organizations like the YMCA,
			The Boys and Girls Club of America and, as well as in schools. <br>It has always been a passion of mine to educate and mentor
		our youth.<br> <br> The challenge was always to stay one-step ahead of the ever changing curriculum.
		<br>I would have to creatively think of ways to keep the class engaged but also  balance what was absolutely
		necessary for them to learn.<br> <br> I have recently become passionate about teaching the English language to foreigners.
		<p> Where I have to be logical is making sure the students understood that mundane grammar rules so they can
		structure the language. I am creative though in how I bring about the lectures.<br> Acting out scenes from movies,
		listening to their favorite songs and, talent shows that all had to be presented in English were definitely some
		of my more popular lessons.<br></p>

		<h3> My Pitch</h3>
		<p>My name is Britt 'Rae' Jack. I am  an entry-level Software developer that wants creatively bring I.T.
		concepts to every home. <br>I am attending the Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp to gain the essential skills I will
		need to achieve this. <br> Do you know about software development?<br></p>
		<h2>Professional</h2>
		<img src="lifeprogress.jpg" alt="My professional progression" width="500">
		<p> The photo on the left side of the page represents my life at sea for the last 6 years<br>
		with the boat being beached, I see that as a representation of how I feel in my professional life.
			<br>Being surrounded  by water but still beached. Feeling of going nowhere in my career.</p>
		<p>The second photo to the right, represents where I would like to go professionally. Hopefully married with a steady job
		<br> and travelling the world, not living paycheck to paycheck.</p>

		<h2> Weekly Reflections</h2>
		<h3> Week 1</h3>
		<p>Today we finally completed week one of the full-stack coding bootcamp.
		It was a challenging week in the sense that this is all brand new and foreign.
		<br>The lingo is very intimidating and so is the backend development part of coding.<br>
		My goal for this upcoming week is to focus on CSS and JavaScript and be more relaxed in class.</p>


		<h3>Week 2</h3>
		<p>This has been a very tough week for me. I have never used databases before and it is a completely foreign concept <br>
		to me. I feel I will need a tutor for this content. PHP and MYSQL is very hard to understand. I am not too happy with my progress this week.<br>
		I hope to eventually learn the essential skills I will need to complete my projects.</p>
