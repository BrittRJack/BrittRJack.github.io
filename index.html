		<!-- My passion section-->
		<h3>My Passion</h3>

		<p>I have been a teacher for the better part of my life. I have taught children ages 3-17 in organizations like the YMCA,
			The Boys and Girls Club of America and, as well as in schools. <br>It has always been a passion of mine to educate and mentor
		our youth.<br> <br> The challenge was always to stay one-step ahead of the ever changing curriculum.
		<br>I would have to creatively think of ways to keep the class engaged but also  balance what was absolutely
		necessary for them to learn.<br> <br> I have recently become passionate about teaching the English language to foreigners.
		<p> Where I have to be logical is making sure the students understood that mundane grammar rules so they can
		structure the language. I am creative though in how I bring about the lectures.<br> Acting out scenes from movies,
		listening to their favorite songs and, talent shows that all had to be presented in English were definitely some
		of my more popular lessons.<br></p>

		<p> The photo on the left side of the page represents my life at sea for the last 6 years<br>
		with the boat being beached, I see that as a representation of how I feel in my professional life.
			<br>Being surrounded  by water but still beached. Feeling of going nowhere in my career.</p>
		<p>The second photo to the right, represents where I would like to go professionally. Hopefully married with a steady job
		<br> and travelling the world, not living paycheck to paycheck.</p>

		<!--Weekly reflections-->
		<h2> Weekly Reflections</h2>

		<!--Week 1-->
		<h3> Week 1</h3>
		<p>Today we finally completed week one of the full-stack coding bootcamp.
		It was a challenging week in the sense that this is all brand new and foreign.
		<br>The lingo is very intimidating and so is the backend development part of coding.<br>
		My goal for this upcoming week is to focus on CSS and JavaScript and be more relaxed in class.</p>

		<!--Week 2-->
		<h3>Week 2</h3>
		<p>This has been a very tough week for me. I have never used databases before and it is a completely foreign concept <br>
		to me. I feel I will need a tutor for this content. PHP and MYSQL is very hard to understand. I am not too happy with my progress this week.<br>
		I hope to eventually learn the essential skills I will need to complete my projects.</p>

		<!--Week 3-->
		<h3> Week 3</h3>
		<p>This week went better than the previous week. I am still confused with Arrays in PHP but I will learn <br>
		I did geta tutor this week and things are coming together slowly but surely.</p>

		<!--Week 4-->
		<h3>Week 4</h3>
		<p>This week feels like a lot of stuff got thrown at our cohort. I am hoping to stay ahead and keep up with homework.<br>
		We played forbidden Island for the first time as a team. We didn't understand the rules so we kind of ended up<br>
		making up the rules on our own. It was fun and we learned a bit of how we all work and it is going to be interesting to see<br>
		how our capstone project comes together.</p>

		<h3>Week 5</h3>
		<h4><strong>One million cups:</strong></h4>
		<p>I really enjoyed the event. I feel that will I continue to attend after boot-camp. <br>
		I do feel is was a bit over saturated with students which made it hard to talk to the entrepreneurs.
		<br> I did talk to one gentleman who was very friendly but looking to recruit solar energy engineers. <br>
			Nice guy, possibly a good connection to have in the future.</p>

		<h4><strong>The rest of week 5:</strong></h4>
		<p>It went well. I do feel that I am starting understand the idea of self learning and figuring out a lot on my own.
		<br>I still have impostor syndrome and feel I will be nowhere near job ready after the boot-camp is over.
		<br>I am getting a bit frustrated will feeling lost or stuck on something and not finding the right resources <br>
		to help me get over that hurdle. Overall, time is winding down and I am really looking forward to finishing this boot-camp.</p>
